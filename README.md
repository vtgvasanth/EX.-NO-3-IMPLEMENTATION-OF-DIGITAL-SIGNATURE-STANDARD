# EX.-NO-3-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DIGITAL-SIGNATURE-STANDARD

## AIM:
To write a C program to implement the signature scheme named digital signature
standard (Euclidean Algorithm).

## ALGORITHM:

  STEP-1: Alice and Bob are investigating a forgery case of x and y.
  
  STEP-2: X had document signed by him but he says he did not sign that document digitally.
  
  STEP-3: Alice reads the two prime numbers p and a.
  
  STEP-4: He chooses a random co-primes alpha and beta and the x’s original signature x.
  
  STEP-5: With these values, he applies it to the elliptic curve cryptographic equation to obtain y.
  
  STEP-6: Comparing this ‘y’ with actual y’s document, Alice concludes that y is a forgery.

## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the simple Code Optimization techniques had been implemented successfully
